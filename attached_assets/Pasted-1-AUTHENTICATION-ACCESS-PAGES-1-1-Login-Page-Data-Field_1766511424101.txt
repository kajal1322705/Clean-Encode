FINAL TRUTH

This is enterprise DMS level, not a startup demo.
If someone can’t build this cleanly, they shouldn’t touch EV operations.

What I can do next (pick one):

Convert this into DB schema (tables + relations)

Generate API contracts (request/response JSON)

Build React pages with dummy data

Create HO-ready PPT / BRD / SRS

Say the number.
